"""
Python Code for Multi-commodity network flow for load planning

This implementation introduces the idea of using
dictionaries of dictionaries in Python to easily hold
and organize lists of data of all types

A dictionary in python contains key,value pairs:

my_dictionary = {key1:value1, key2:value2, ...}

and you can always add new key,value pairs later.  What
makes them nice is that the "key" can be just about any
object, and so can the "value".  Importantly, the "value"
can be another dictionary:

my_dictionary = {key1:{key1_1:value1_1, ...}, key2:{key2_1:value2_1, ...}, ... }
